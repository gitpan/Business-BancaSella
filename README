Business::BancaSella README File
================================

Introduction
------------
Banca Sella is an italian banking istitute which offers an online payment system
with credit card based on a SSL server.

This system may call a form on which will be acquired all informations needed
to a correct credit card transaction or may be used only for checking credit 
card and executing transaction.

In both cases, the merchant redirects purchaser on Banca Sella's server and 
receives then, from Banca Sella, confirmation or not about correct payment 
through the construction fo a determinate internet address (url) well formatted
to send purchased data to Banca Sella and to receive from it confirmation or not 
about payment.

This module helps in the construction of the sending url and in the decoding of 
the reply url from Banca Sella hiddening url complexity using classes that 
encapsulate comunication parameters from and to Banca Sella.

During data sending phase to Banca Sella's server it will be inizialized an 
object of type Business::BancaSella::Encode using the purchased parameters 
(amount, internal purchased id, currency) and the istance will automatically
build url for calling Banca Sella's web system.

During replying phase it will be inizialized an object of type 
Business::BancaSella::Decode with the query string passed in the url from Banca
Sella and, automatically, the opportune parameters will be set with values
relative to result's transaction, optional error code, purchased id to which
transaction is related and so on.

Actually this library implements Banca Sella online system payment called 
"compatibility gateway" and "gestpay". 

Indeed, given that the autentication of comunication between purchaser to Banca
Sella and back uses keys called "One-Time-Password" sending from Banca Sella
to merchant when he opens an account, this module implements two parent classes
Business::BancaSella::Ric and Business::BancaSella::Ris. The first used for
recovering keys need during comunications with Banca Sella and the other for 
checking the autentication of keys sending from Banca Sella in the reply.

Actually these keys could be stored in a file, in a table in a Mysql database
or in an improved ascii file well formatted to increase passwords 
search speed. Thanks to Marco Gazerro <gazerro@open2b.com> for this 
modules.
